I just want your company
To come sit right in front of me
You don′t need to say a thingNo commitment, no wedding ring
I've been kinda sleep-deprived
Just hopin′ you might stay the night
Miss your presence in my bedroom
Now I lay with too much legroom

Head up on my chest
I'm not tired, just wanna rest
I miss you sayin' "hey" to me
When there′s nothin′ to say to me
You just stayed the night
You gotta leave and go get dressed
Last night you left a couple things
Your rings are on my pillow sheet

I just want your company
To come sit right in front of me
You don't need to say a thing
No commitment, no wedding ring
I′ve been kinda sleep-deprived
Just hopin' you might stay the night
Miss your presence in my bedroom
Now I lay with too much legroom

My car′s been feeling empty
And my seats, they haven't moved
I can′t find a song to play
Keep messin' with the tune
Got so used to doing trips
With you just right beside
It's only been a day or two
It sucks to say "goodbye", bye

I just want your company
To come sit right in front of me
You don′t need to say a thing
No commitment, no wedding ring
I′ve been kinda sleep-deprived
Just hopin' you might stay the night
Miss your presence in my bedroom
Now I lay with too much legroom

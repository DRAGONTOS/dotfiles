30 pictures for the moment that we touched
Is there any better than this?
34 little rules for making lust
And the purple poison that I kissed

(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
These inhibitions sucker me in
No you don't feel the same
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
These tentacles live under my skin
No you don't feel ashamed

Oh, confidence exude
God, I love that attitude
Shudder from the shutter, shut up and make me glad that I did this with you

I gotta know, I gotta know
Maybe we should lose control
Animate me cause I got no soul
Baby, I'm in the zone
Make your move and watch the camera roll
Add another keyframe and make me moan
Cause, baby, I'm in the zone

Filling ditches for the gap in your brassiere
My mind just wasn't enough
Slow it down make this moment last a year
Just please don't call it love

(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
Flicking sheets and sketching the scene
Oh, those strokes that you do
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
(You're a mess)
You were scarlet, I was still green
An artist, through and through

Oh, confidence exude
God, I love that attitude
Shudder from the shutter, shut up and make me glad that I did this with you

I gotta know, I gotta know
Maybe we should lose control
Animate me cause I got no soul
Baby, I'm in the zone
Make your move and watch the camera roll
Add another keyframe and make me moan
Cause, baby, I'm in the zone

Muttering
Your name out I'm stuttering
Mind goes blank
It's glorious
And without a care
I felt you there

I gotta know
Animate me cause I got no soul
Baby, I'm in the zone
Make your move and watch the camera roll
Add another keyframe and make me moan
Make it last cause, baby, I'm in the zone

Yeah, we should lose control
(I'm a mess)
(I'm a mess)
(I'm a mess)
(I'm a mess)
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Oh, baby, I'm in the zone
Make your move and watch the camera roll
Staring through the lens, now we just ain't friends, you know
Baby, I'm in the zone

(Oooo~)
Baby, I'm in the Zone

Shut up and trust this

Moving forward directionally
Meant to be taking strides in our lives intellectually
Infecting me with a cure that I was never meant to see

I'll make you feel better
Yeah, I'll make you feel sane
There's a second voice inside my head it tells me

Shut up and trust this (Yeah...)
I wanna go
I wanna know
I wanna show you something better than before
So, shut up and trust this
Oh, I can't take it any more

I'm like a crimson flame
Maybe if I try then I can spark and ignite her
Yeah when I called, you came
You twisted the thorn but you made me brighter

I'll make you feel better
Yeah, I'll make you feel sane
There's a second voice inside my head it tells me

Shut up and trust this (Yeah...)
I wanna go
I wanna know
I wanna show you something better than before
So, shut up and trust this
Oh, I can't take it any more

We level like an RPG
We're magnitude 10, you're magnitude 3.3
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
I'm so conflicted and you're so restricted

Listen, listen, listen
To the sound of my voice
And drown out all the pain
Yeah, it's okay to cry I wonder why I feel the same

I'm like a crimson flame
Maybe if I try then I can spark and ignite her
But she feels bruised and maimed
Maybe she's not listening to the voice inside her

I'll make you feel better
Yeah, I'll make you feel sane
There's a second voice inside my head it tells me

Mmm, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna go
I wanna know
I wanna show you something better than before
So shut up and trust this

Yeah...
I wanna go
I wanna know
I wanna show you something better than before
So, shut up and trust this
Oh, I can't take it any more

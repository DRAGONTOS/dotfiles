She's got a fetish for fine art
A pair of knee-socks and an oversized sweatshirt
She goes right to my heart
She comes a'knocking with her stocking and I get hurt

I get the feeling I'm in deep
Troubled waters, but they're only thigh-high
This kind of girl don't get no sleep
Don't wake your father, skip the starters, strap those garters up
Oh my my!

Checkered pattern on your skirt
I see you flaunting, see you taunting, it's so sickening
I can't resist the way you flirt
I should be dead but my heartbeat's quickening

I get the feeling less is more
It's an excuse just to shake your little derri√®re
That ratio; a perfect score
A girl's status is measured by her denier

Lie down baby
Arch your back now
Maybe you can help me get what I want
Curve your little spine and tell me that you're mine
It's all about the game and what you flaunt
Yeah, I know that there's no pleasing you
When you know that you're not teasing me
She's an absolute terror for Absolute Territory

(You're so hotly contested, here's a tip
You should rename your thighs to the Gaza Strip)

That's it, baby, take control
You're so enticing, mesmerizing, don't know how to react
You're gonna steal my very soul
More manslaughter than the third impact

I see you strutting in that pleat
Double-taking, yeah I'm shaking and you know it shows
This kind of girl just can't be beat
She whispers in my ear
"Take off your clothes"

Lie down baby
Arch your back now
Maybe you can help me get what I want
Curve your little spine and tell me that you're mine
It's all about the game and what you flaunt
Yeah, I know that there's no pleasing you
When you know that you're not teasing me
She's an absolute terror for Absolute Territory

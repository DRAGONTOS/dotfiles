There's a spark in your eye
And a grin on your lips
She's a demon, and I can't resist her
On a night like this

Say that you're fine
But I know that you're a wreck
There's a chill up my spine
With your hands around my neck

Handcuffed to your side
I know that I can't leave
I'm fixated on asphyxiation
But without you I can't breathe

Oooo You never say please
Might as well be deceased

Yeah I'll make sure this sticks
Fall for all of your tricks
Oh, I gotta admit
I kinda dig crazy chicks

Tossing, turning, I run through your mind
You'd kill for me?
Yeah, you're creepy when you're kind
Who knew
That voodoo
Could do so much for me?
Got me under your hex, yeah, I'm perplexed
I'm a doll in your hands and it's oh-so plain to see

This must be a sign
That I'm going insane
Cause you're on the right track, with your knife to my back
And your laugh inside my brain (Ha-ha!)

I can never say no
Your sanity's all for show
Yeah I'll take all your kicks
The hi-hats and the clicks
It's another quick fix

I kinda dig crazy chicks
I kinda dig crazy chicks
I kinda dig crazy chicks

Tossing, turning, I run through your mind
You'd kill for me?
Yeah, you're creepy when you're kind
Who knew
That voodoo
Could do so much for me?
Got me under your hex, yeah, I'm perplexed
I'm a doll in your hands and it's oh-so plain to see

I'm a doll in your hands and it's oh so plain to see
I'm a doll in your hands and it's oh so plain to see

Yeah we're burning that midnight oil
Ooo I kinda dig crazy chicks

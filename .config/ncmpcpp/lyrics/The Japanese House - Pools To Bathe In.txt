You go out and have your fun
With my head and mind and my heart in your hands
You said you′re looking for someoneWho doesn't take one look and understand

I get such a rush with my head out the window
Flying past your love, you learn how to let go

Oh, I′m changing
Crazed and cradling what I've bathed in

I was raw, sick, and thin
It wasn't hard to let my head cave in
It′s easy feeding fears with flowers
And staying wild while I′m just a child

I get such a rush with my head out the window
Flying past your love, you learn how to let go

Oh, I'm changing
Crazed and cradling what I′ve bathed in back then

Oh, I'm fading
Crazed and cradling pools to bathe in

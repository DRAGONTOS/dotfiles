This is my war song all for you
I just do not know what to do
I keep on coming back it's true
At 10 I knew my place was here
So leave your doubts and have no fear
The righteous path is clear

Pay me no heed I'm about to cause a shakeup
Why won't you just wake up?
Why can't you just take up
Arms to defend yourself against me?
Dashing young rogues can't be helped when consecrated
I still stand elated
Even when berated
Wish you could just see what I see
The gates have opened once again
A winter valley, summer sand
And all my friends, they tell me
"Yeah, you got class
Yeah, you got style
How will you make it at 85?
This world's a battleground
You're lucky, even now, to be alive"

From the ruins to the flag
I'll take it back I'll strike you down
I'll strike you down

Tol Barad
It ain't so bad
Surrounded by my friends
Brave the weather
Fight the storm
Stay together
Live once more
Overpowered, my desire
Is to meet you in that spire
I'm on fire, can't cool down, oh can't you see?
It means too much to me
My life is PVP

Under-geared everywhere I look around me
Gnomes can still astound me
Trying to confound me
We don't have this problem, but you do
Excuse me miss, but I'd like to cash my honor
Thought I was a goner
Should have done a runner
But I still stood and fought for you

From the ruins to the flag
I'll take it back I'll strike you down
I'll strike you down

Tol Barad
It ain't so bad
Surrounded by my friends
Brave the weather
Fight the storm
Stay together
Live once more
Overpowered, my desire
Is to meet you in that spire
I'm on fire, can't cool down, oh can't you see?
It means too much to me
My life is PVP

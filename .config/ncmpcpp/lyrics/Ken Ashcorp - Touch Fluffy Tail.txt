Pick up my sword, it's time to do business
Strap on my cloak, I'm 'bout to roll with this
When you're this swag, this world just bows at your knees
Call me the chef, 'cause I'll make your blood boil
(Hora, hora)
Gimme some of that coil
Snake oil 'cause you know I aim to please

Tickle my fancy, tickle my prostate
Don't get me off 'cause I'll just get irate
Put in my place, but I'll break out once again
All these encounters may just leave me scarred
And when I'm rock hard, I'm fucking rock hard
Like Alice, we're down the rabbit hole, my friend

I don't give a damn, not an iota
Motherfucker, I'm the straightest shota

I'm on a quest, of which I know, that I can never fail
I will prevail
Even though there may be many foes stalking my trail
I'm in love
Weak at the knees, and yeah I'm growing pale
Only one thing left to do
Touch Fluffy Tail

Lately, I know, I'm going so crazy
Never thought goodness would be so hazy
Once you wrap me up, yeah you know I'm caught
But sorry, baby, I just can't get with this
Gotta get out and get back to business
Tofu or tail? Oh, it's food for thought

I don't give a damn, not an iota
Motherfucker, I'm the straightest shota

I'm on a quest, of which I know, that I can never fail
I will prevail
Even though there may be many foes stalking my trail
I'm in love
Weak at the knees, and yeah I'm growing pale
Only one thing left to do
Touch Fluffy Tail

We'll see the light of day again, my dear
Let's go on an adventure
The heavens frown upon us on this day
But I've still got my quota
Motherfucker I'm the straightest shota

I'm on a quest, of which I know, that I can never fail
I will prevail
Even though there may be many foes stalking my trail
I'm in love
Weak at the knees, and yeah I'm growing pale
Only one thing left to do
Touch Fluffy Tail

Ooh
I'm in love
Weak at the knees and yeah I'm growing pale
Only one thing left to do
Touch Fluffy Tail

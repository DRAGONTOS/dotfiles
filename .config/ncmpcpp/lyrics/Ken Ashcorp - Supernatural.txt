Yeah, I'll gravitate towards you
Or you'll miss me when I'm gone
Cause things are getting creepy in this sleepy state of Oregon
And I'm gonna set things straight again
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna show the world the supernatural

I wasn't prepared to be a scared young boy
I wasn't prepared to be read like Tolstoy
And destroy
These feelings I feel inside

This war and peace inside my mind
Finding things I shouldn't find
This time they're out to get you
You kinda scare me and I wanna let you

Go
And find another adventure
C'mon let's go
I found something interesting and we should discover it together

Yeah, I'll gravitate towards you
Or you'll miss me when I'm gone
Cause things are getting creepy in this sleepy state of Oregon
And I'm gonna set things straight again
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna show the world the supernatural

I wasn't prepared to be a full grown man
I wasn't prepared to take your hand
A plan?
You already know me
Feel this one and just go with me

An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
If I can't see then I can't find
These things that are out to get you
You kinda scare me and I wanna let you

Go
And find another adventure
C'mon let's go
I found something interesting and we should discover it together

Yeah, I'll gravitate towards you
Or you'll miss me when I'm gone
Cause things are getting creepy in this sleepy state of Oregon
And I'm gonna set things straight again
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna show the world the supernatural

Call my name
I'm still here
Feeling safe
When you're near
This magic is tragic
Just to see me smile
Won't you hold me for a while?

Yeah, I'll gravitate towards you
Or you'll miss me when I'm gone
Cause things are getting creepy in this sleepy state of Oregon
And I'm gonna set things straight again
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna show the world the supernatural

Yeah, I'll gravitate towards you
Or you'll miss me when I'm gone
Cause things are getting creepy in this sleepy state of Oregon
And I'm gonna set things straight again
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna show the world the supernatural

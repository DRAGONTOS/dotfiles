I feel safe when I'm bruised and helpless
I like it when I'm crying so hard that I'm breathless
Not many people get this
I'm guess I'm fucking selfish
I get happy when you tell me that you're angry
I get sad when you have nothing to say to me
Not many people can be
In this position that you've put me

My knees are blue and bloody my bones are weak and tired
You just stare and laugh all while you set me on fire
I wish that I could kill you but I love to feel this way
I'll fight back when I'm strong but I'm not strong enough today

I feel best when I am close to dying
You make me feel so sick and I wish that I was lying
And every night I'm crying
But I still need what you're providing
You have me right where I always should be
You bring me shivers so sharp that it could cut me
And if you set me free
I'll beg you just to keep me

My knees are blue and bloody my bones are weak and tired
You just stare and laugh all while you set me on fire
I wish that I could kill you but I love to feel this way
I'll fight back when I'm strong but I
I'm not strong enough
My knees are blue and bloody my bones are weak and tired
You just stare and laugh all while you set me on fire
I wish that I could kill you but I love to feel this way
I'll fight back when I'm strong but I'm not strong enough today
